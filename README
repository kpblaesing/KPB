Hello i am New Here and this is my first Git text file

To Start you require a dongle for GPS Geoinformation for your Car it is to connect to your ODB II Connector in Your Car
normally found in the Front under the Steering Weel or Middle Console or Glove Box Compartment 

Once this has been found you require it to be powered by your Car Battery

The Aim of the Git is to Control and view the Status of the Car Components relative to a geo Area such as Parking Lot or 
other Controlled Area

The Control should be from Android OS Tablet IOS based Tablet Windows Based Tablet

or Mac Laptop with Lion or Windows based Laptop with Windows 7 or Later
